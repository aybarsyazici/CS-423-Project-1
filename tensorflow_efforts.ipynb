For example, a 1-unit-per-10-grams-of-carb (1:10) ratio means that one unit of insulin covers 10 grams of carbohydrate. A 1:20 ratio means that each unit covers 20 grams. Calculating a meal or snack dose becomes simple when you know your I:C ratio: Simply divide your carbs by your ratio.'],\n",

Biographer Brenda Maddox called her the Dark Lady of DNA, based on a once disparaging reference to Franklin by one of her coworkers.ndeed, Franklin is in the shadows of science history, for while her work on DNA was crucial to the discovery of its structure, her contribution to that landmark discovery is little known.
